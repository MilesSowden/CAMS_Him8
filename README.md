# Analysis of CAMS Reanalysis Dataset over the Himawari-8 Observational Area, Including China, Indonesia, and Australia (2016-2023)
A Comprehensive Analysis of Ground-level Concentrations of Aerosols and Criteria Pollutants Using the CAMS Reanalysis Dataset over the Himawari-8 Observational Area, Including China, Indonesia, and Australia (2016-2023)

**Abstract:** This study evaluates ground-level concentrations (GLCs) of aerosols and criteria pollutants using the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis dataset over eight years for the majority of the Himawari-8 observational land area, covering China, Indonesia, and Australia. Our analysis focused on normalizing data using a square root transformation to mitigate skewness and by subtracting the monthly-hourly long-term average to determine abnormalities and identify significant pollution events. The study employed Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR) and the Jacobian matrix (dY/dX) methods to determine the spatial variability in pollutant concentrations and their correlations with meteorological factors. The findings revealed complex interactions between atmospheric dynamics, such as wind components, specific humidity, and pollutant distribution. The analysis highlighted the limitations of traditional point monitoring methods and the need for incident-based spatiotemporal approaches to understand pollution dynamics. This comprehensive evaluation, covering roughly 10% of the globe, demonstrates CAMS's effectiveness in providing detailed insights into air quality trends, which can support targeted public health interventions and robust environmental policies. Integrating CAMS data with high-resolution satellite data like Himawari-8 could revolutionize air quality monitoring by delivering dynamic, near real-time outputs with fine spatial resolution.
